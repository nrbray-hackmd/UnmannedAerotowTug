## Unmanned Aircraft System Operations in UK Airspace 

23 July 2019 - A new edition of CAP 722 has been published. The update follows amendments to the Air Navigation Order and splits the content into three separate documents:

### [CAP722](https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/CAP722) [`Guidance & Policy, .pdf`](https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP722_Edition7_A3_SEP2019_20190903.pdf)

> intended to assist those who are involved with the **development, manufacture or operation of UAS** to identify the route to follow in order that the appropriate operational authorisation(s) may be obtained and to ensure that the required standards and practices are met. Its content is primarily intended for non-recreational UAS operators
> 
> highlights the safety requirements that have to be met, in terms of airworthiness and/or operational standards, before a UAS is allowed to operate inthe UK

---

### [CAP722A](http://www.caa.co.uk/CAP722A) [`Operating Safety Cases, .pdf`](https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP722A-UASOSC.pdf)

> is intended to assist those involved in the **production of an Operating Safety Case** (OSC) which will be used as supporting evidence to an application to the CAA for operation of an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). The intent is to ensure that the required  operational safety requirements have been met and best practice is adopted by all UAS operators before a UAS is authorised to operate in the UK. 
> 
> The aim of the OSC is to present sufficient evidence that all relevant hazards and resultant safety risks have been identified within an operation and that these safety risks have been reduced to a Tolerable and As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) level

---


### [CAP722B](http://www.caa.co.uk/CAP722B) [`National Qualified Entity, .pdf`](https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP_722B%20Requirements_for_UK_NQE_Approval.pdf)

> to lay down the requirements that must be met for an organisation to be granted an approval by the UK CAA as a National Qualified Entity (NQE) in the Full or Restricted category under Article 268 of the UK Air Navigation Order 2016 (ANO)
